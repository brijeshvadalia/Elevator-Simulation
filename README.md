# Elevator System Simulation & Optimization

A web-based elevator simulation system with intelligent scheduling algorithm.

## Features

- Visual simulation of multiple elevators serving multiple floors
- Intelligent scheduling algorithm that:
  - Minimizes average wait time and travel time
  - Prevents request starvation
  - Balances elevator utilization
  - Implements user experience priorities
- Interactive controls to adjust simulation parameters
- Real-time metrics display

## Technologies

- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Real-time communication: REST API

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
